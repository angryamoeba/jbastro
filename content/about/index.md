Hi, I'm Josh and welcome to J.B. Astro. I started astrophotography in 2020 after a long hiatus from astronomy. I've rekindled my love for all things space and wanted to have a place to share all the things I learn, mistakes I make, and the tools and resources that I utilize to enjoy this hobby. I am in a Bortle class 5 zone, but travel quite often to better skies. I'm hoping to bring along my equipment to get more and better photos of our night sky. Follow along my socials to join in the community. For any questions, feel free to hit me up on any of the socials.
